# ðŸ§© **Client-Server Architecture â€“ Questions with Answers & Explanations**

---

### ðŸ”¸ **1. What is client-server architecture?**

* **Answer:** Itâ€™s a computing model where the client requests services and the server provides them.
* **Explanation:** This design separates concerns â€” clients handle UI; servers handle logic/data.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **2. How is a client different from a server?**

* **Answer:** A client initiates requests; a server waits for and processes them.
* **Explanation:** Clients are consumers, servers are providers.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **3. What are the key components of a client-server system?**

* **Answer:** Client, Server, Network, Protocols (e.g., HTTP, TCP/IP).
* **Explanation:** Each part handles a specific layer of communication and data exchange.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **4. What is a stateless server?**

* **Answer:** A server that does not retain session information between requests.
* **Explanation:** Common in REST APIs, improves scalability.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **5. Whatâ€™s the difference between 2-tier and 3-tier architecture?**

* **Answer:** 2-tier: client â†” DB server; 3-tier: client â†” app server â†” DB.
* **Explanation:** 3-tier adds a middle (application) layer for better separation and scalability.

* **Answer:** Stores frequent responses to reduce load and response time.
* **Explanation:** Done on client (browser), CDN, or server side.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **25. What is REST and how does it fit client-server model?**

* **Answer:** REST is an API style that uses HTTP for stateless communication.
* **Explanation:** It decouples clients and servers for flexible, scalable design.

* **Answer:** Use load balancing, horizontal scaling, async servers (e.g., Nginx), and message queues.
* **Explanation:** Scale stateless services, optimize I/O, and distribute load efficiently.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **37. A client app fails to connect during DNS failover. What's your approach?**

* **Answer:** Check DNS TTL, client-side DNS caching, or lack of retry logic.
* **Explanation:** Failover depends on how quickly DNS changes propagate and are respected.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **38. A client can connect but gets intermittent "timeout" errors. What tools help debug?**

* **Answer:** Use `tcpdump`, `wireshark`, or server logs to trace the flow.
* **Explanation:** Might be due to load spikes, packet loss, or poor timeout settings.

---

* **Explanation:** Used in WebSockets, message brokers, and monitoring.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **42. A WebSocket connection drops after some time. What might cause this?**

* **Answer:** Idle timeout on firewall, reverse proxy, or server config.
* **Explanation:** Ensure proper keep-alive and timeout settings on all layers.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **43. What are sticky sessions in load balancing?**

* **Answer:** Sessions are tied to one server for consistency.
* **Explanation:** Useful when session state is stored locally, but reduces flexibility.

---

* **Answer:** Could be SYN flood attack. Use SYN cookies or increase backlog in `sysctl`.
* **Explanation:** Protects the TCP handshake stage from being overloaded.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **46. How does client-side rendering vs. server-side rendering impact client-server load?**

* **Answer:** Client-side shifts work to the client; server-side increases server load.
* **Explanation:** SSR improves SEO; CSR is more scalable with good caching.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **47. What are idempotent operations in client-server systems?**

* **Answer:** Operations that produce the same result if repeated.
* **Explanation:** GET, PUT are idempotent. POST is not. Important for retry logic.

---

### ðŸ”¸ **48. Your app uses API calls to a third-party server thatâ€™s rate-limited. How do you handle it?**
